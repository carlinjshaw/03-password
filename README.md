This password generator starts with 5 prompts, has fail-safe if incorrect amount of charcaters is selected, and then a series of if statements ensues in tehe code. 
Each if statement represents every possible combination of the four binary options. 
In each if statement is an array of every relevant character type, math.random objects and more if statements with more mathrandom objects. 
Finally the generated password is put into the textarea html element by the ID password.
